# Potential ideas
## Idea 1

* **Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?** <br>
When I was a kid, I used to play a game called Circus Charlie in Nintendo, I loved this game! Circus is about controlling a clown named Charlie to grab money bags, performing dangerous tricks, avoiding enemies, completing stages, etc. through 6 different stages. <br> <br>
I loved this game! This is why  I want to make my own version of it for little kids as my niece and nephew to experience what I experienced as a kid. I could use the character "Trompita" that I created for my midterm and create the same sketchy environment. I would like to focus on one of the stages which was about riding on a lion and jumping through flaming rings (as shown in Image1). I will use elements as lives (hearts) and buttons to play and stop. I would also like to show fireworks when the player wins!. Image 2 shows a prototype of this idea.

* **What are your inputs?**<br>
  * The user could use the arrows on the keyboard to move Trompita and jump through the fire rings.
  * The user will click the buttons Play and Stop at any time during the game.


* **What are your outputs?**
 * Trompita will jump when the up arrow is pressed. The more times the up arrow is consequently pressed, the higher Trompita will jump.
 * When the play button is pressed, the game will start.
 * When the stop button is pressed, the game will stop.
 * When Trompita touches one fire ring, he will loose a life and a heart will disappear.
 * Trompita has only 3 lives (3 hearts) until the game is over.


* **Who is the target audience for your project?** <br>
The target audience for my project are kids from 5 + years old. However, it could also be played by adults, as some games have become very popular within the millennial culture just  because of its simplicity.


* **Where will your project be displayed?**<br>
The game could be played in a tablet or computer.
