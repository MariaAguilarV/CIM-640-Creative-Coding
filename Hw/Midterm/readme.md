* Who is the target audience for your project?
<br> My target audience are kids from 3 to 7 years old. In this range of ages, kids will understand the logic of the game and also between these ages, kids tend to become bored quickly, thus, this game will be a fun way to keep little children busy while parents are buying!

* Where will your project be displayed?
I would project this game in big screens at family stores. I would use a screen as the one showed above.
