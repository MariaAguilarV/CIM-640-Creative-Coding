##  My perfect planner: Save time and reduce stress!

Sometimes, when I have many upcoming assignments, I spend more time thinking of how I'm going to distribute my time, rather on actually start my to do list. This is a mobile application that provides a personalized schedule to spend time efficiently.

1. When the application opens, you have to add events (classes, dates or appointments) for each day or you could import your events from your preferred calendar.

2. In the next screen, the application will show all your events in a list, and you have to add assignments and their due date for each event.

3. Finally, the application will give you a schedule with daily responsibilities. Based on previous experience from other users, the application will distribute all the activities in different days taking into consideration their due dates, the time each one takes to finish, meal hours, enough sleep, etc. You only need to follow the plan to finish your assignments on date! The planner will also keep track of social media activity and it will show notifications when you are spending too much time on social media and have upcoming assignments.
